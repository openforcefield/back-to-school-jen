WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/jenniferclark/mamba/envs/bts/lib/python3.12/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/deprecation.py:588: calling function (from tensorflow.python.eager.polymorphic_function.polymorphic_function) with experimental_relax_shapes is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
experimental_relax_shapes is deprecated, use reduce_retracing instead
